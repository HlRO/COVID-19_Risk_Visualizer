# COVID-19_Risk_Visualizer
The exponential nature of the disease spread overwhelms peopleâ€™s risk perception and make it hard for them to associate the risk to their daily actions. This proposal is to provide data visualization that helps people understand the risk in relation to their live and helps them take right actions.
## Usage
Launch the web service locally.
```
cd covid_risk_visualizer

Then, access http://0.0.0.0:5000/ using a web browser.
